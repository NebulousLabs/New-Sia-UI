I am only certain about development flow for linux. If you are developing on
another operating system, please expand this documentation.

You will need npm and gconf. Most linux installations will already have gconf.
You should also have tar and zip. To get started, run 'make dependencies && make'.

## Ming's brief guide to javascript!

We use three major tools in this application and they follow this hierarchy:
Javascript -> Node.js -> Electron

### Javascript

Javascript itself works with a fluid definition of objects. All primitives are
pass by value, though objects themselves are passed by reference. This is
called
["call-by-sharing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_sharing).

### Node.js

Working with Node.js, one has to get used to callbacks and asynchronous
programming. Essentially, along series of operations that deal with Node
libraries, every call returns immediately in a non-blocking manner. Every
subsequent action cannot guarantee that every previous action was processed to
completion, and in fact assumes the opposite to ensure determinism.

### Electron

Lastly, our tool to develop desktop applications is Electron. It gives us a
variety of tools to easily work with desktop tools like file paths to
browser-windows. The best way to get acquainted with this tool quickly is to
read the codebase, referring to electron's documentation when necessary.

### Modularize!

In order to avoid [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/):
1. Try to name most anonymous functions
2. If it makes sense for readability, move the named functions out to a more
logical place, perhaps even with some other functions into another .js file

## Makefile/NPM-package.json philosophy:
(perhaps this was unnecessary but throw me a bone)
The Makefile provides the most functionality and is the master set of commands.

It uses npm commands where convenient. E.g. using `npm install` in make
dependencies instead of manually getting the node_modules for electron and
other dev tools from their github repos.

NPM makes certain commands more efficient, but should not become overly
complex. E.g. npm scripts will do single jobs and be used here like:
```mf
run: lint
	npm start
lint:
	npm run lint
```
defined in package.json as:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "electron app",
  "lint": "jshint app/. --exclude app/libs/",
  "env": "env"
},
```
as opposed to package.json having these commands chain together via:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "electron app",
  "prestart": "jshint app/. --exclude app/libs/",
  "env": "env"
},
```
which would have npm start run npm prestart and do two tasks unseen in the
Makefile.

That would be relying too much on the node ecosystem.
